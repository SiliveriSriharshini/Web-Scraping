By Ajay Bidyarthy - 25 , 9232 Anything could give rise smarter-than-human – form , brain-computer interfaces , neuroscience-based enhancement – wins hands beyond contest change world . Nothing else even league. –Eliezer Yudkowsky , Researcher There ’ denying robots automation increasingly part daily lives . Just look around grocery store , highway , everywhere . This makes wonder replace ? make tomorrow ? Let try find answers questions . Let ’ first understand – basically machines displaying . This seen machine playing chess robot answering questions Facebook . broken many different types . There AIs designed specific tasks , detecting specific type cancer . However , also AIs multiple tasks , driving car . There many types AIs . Among top , important fields Learning ML , Neural Network , Computer Vision , Natural Language Processing NLP . Learning idea machines able prove similar learns new skill . Learning also allows optimization existing skill . Learning used many different fields one application entertainment . Netflix uses Learning recommend shows watch based shows already seen . Neural Networks algorithms modeled brain . These algorithms think like thereby give similar results give . Neural Networks used medical fields diagnose cancers like lung cancer prostate cancer . Computer Vision idea computers visions . This allows see things way beings potentially better beings , depending programming , camera used , etc . Computer Vision used autonomous vehicles navigation one place another . Natural Language Processing idea computers listen say . example Siri . Siri able listen demands , process means , answer based researched . Now know , Let ’ talk issue . WILL MACHINE REPLACE THE HUMAN IN THE FUTURE OF WORK ? AIs allow automation jobs , thereby replacing humans already . This means job loss concentration wealth selected people . This could mean destabilization social unrest . In addition social unrest , improves time . This means becomes smarter , faster , cheaper better repetitive things humans currently , preparing fast food . It predicted improve much 100 years become super intelligent . This means become even smarter intelligent earth . According many experts Elon Musk , could cause end civilization . could potentially start war humans , burn crops sorts tragedies reserved functions . At point , theory , stop would already thought obstacles prevent goal . This means unplug machine , effect replace . But , happen next years ? NO ! The field sophisticated enough many tasks humans currently . Currently , smart enough empathetic humans think strategically enough solve complex . solutions expensive go many different tests standards . It also takes time improve . For example , Boston Dynamics , one world ’ top robotics company robot 2009 needed assistance walk . Fast forward 2019 , robot could walk could jump objects , backflips much . In addition timing , takes time price new technological drop point affordable . For example , desktop computer costs around $ 1000 1999 get significantly powerful laptop exact price . go curve . But happens years ? Will make obsolete ? Maybe . As proven earlier become faster better cheaper . As happens , companies use automate jobs save money , productivity , importantly , stay competitive . As demonstrated , become better repetition via use machine learning . The difference able learn faster time progresses due amount available today . It also able learn machines similar machines learn optimize tasks new important skills . However , also repetitive routine tasks better , also able understand emotional , ethics , creativity . This seen three distinct example- IBM IBM uses IBM Watson program create movie trailer . Fox approached IBM said movie coming # Scifi horror . They asked IBM platform IBM Watson could trailer reviewing watching footage searching scary , WILL MACHINE REPLACE THE HUMAN IN THE FUTURE OF WORK ? Sad happy moments movie provoked quality emotions based machine programmed identify emotions quantifiable manner . IBM Watson able generate trailer movie Morgan . The result , movie trailer created machines example – IN google demonstrated assistance could take calls simple stuff . The able set appointment ! fascinating able understand nuances conversation . The receptionist thought calling . That primitive version possible . Eventually , able conversations beings , making many sales jobs obsolete . example – generated art In , Paris art collective consisting three students used artificial generate portrait . It generated portrait painting studying set fifteen thousand art images wiki art . It estimated worth seven thousand ten thousand dollars . The painting sold auction four thirty-five thousand dollars . However , sure say replace . This started asking hard questions questioning ethics . Elon Musk founded Open , research lab whose whole purpose promote discover artificial way benefits humanity . In addition , many factors affect long-term outcome replacing . Like , degree humans allow take ? Depending field , people even want help ? Or prefer counterpart ? While may able control happens long run , definitely secure short-term future . Here top five skills become obsolete near future Strategic creative thinking The ability think outside box . There thousands upon thousands slightly different possible may result every distinguishable action mind ability judge experience programmed purposes far sophisticated manner currently achieve . As billionaire founder Alibaba , Jack Ma famously said – logic , beings wisdom . Conflict resolution negotiations With understanding complexities human-related processes ability improvise judge , far better equipped deal conflicts robots ever likely . WILL MACHINE REPLACE THE HUMAN IN THE FUTURE OF WORK ? Emotional Empathy may able recognize faces images rarely successfully read feelings faces . Humans , lesser greater degrees , capable accurate analysis emotional subtext . With application intuition use delicately worded elusive languages , methods , able properly judge person feels . Interpretation Gray Areas Robots computers function well presented quantifiable . However , situation enters gray area , whether term refers morals , processes , definitions robots likely falter . Critical thinking Humans capable responding indicators quality computers . While system may able analyze documents according true false statements made within text , judge whether well written analyze implication use certain words overall meaning content . : Fiza Parveen , Shri Govindram Institute Technology Science , Indore revolution machine learning Robots Will Replace Us Work With Us ?
